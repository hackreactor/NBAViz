    <p> The MoneyBaller tool is an app that gives you the power to see what NBA stats matter most in determining team rankings.  By moving sliders, you can assign weights to a whole host of stats.  </p>
    <p>There are two ways to visualize:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The power ranking view allows you to see team rankings dynamically reorder as you adjust the sliders</li>
        <li> The scatter plot view allows you to see how well your combination of stat weights can be used to predict team win percentage.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's rho</a> metric is shown at the top as feedback.</li>
      </ul>
