MoneyBaller
=========

MoneyBaller combines classic NBA statistics with new player tracking data to allow users to create their own custom power rankings and MVP races.  By changing presets or moving sliders, users can watch their favorite teams and players rise and fall in real time.

The accuracy of the settings is calculated using linear regression against actual team win/loss records, and registered users can save their settings as new presets.

There are four ways to visualize:
* The power ranking view allows you to see team rankings dynamically reorder as you adjust the sliders
* The players view allows you to see the top 25 players according to the current stat weightings.
* The moving average view compares user-selected players and/or teams and shows the ups and downs over the course of the season.
* The scatter plot view allows you to see how well your combination of stat weights can be used to predict team win percentage.  The [Spearman's rho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient) metric is shown at the top as feedback.
